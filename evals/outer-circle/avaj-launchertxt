0) Compilation


Compile the program with the commands described in the subject.
Does the project compile?


1) Validation


Check if the program validates the input file. Try running the
program without an input file present, with inconsistent data,
missing values or out of range values. Does the validation work?


2) Exception handling


Does the project contain custom exceptions for treating
abnormarl behaviour specific to the program? Are they relevant?
Do they have good messages?


3) Program design


Does project respect the UML class diagram to the letter? It is
not a problem if there are additional classes or private
attributes and methods added by the student.


4) Simulation


Is the simulation.txt file generated acording to the
specifications? Check to see if the ID is unique and if all
messages are logged correctly.


5) Security


Feed the program with a valid input file, where the contents
where previously encrypted with MD5. Does the program have the
same behaviour as with the non-encrypted file?
