0) Simple preliminaries

- Nothing submitted (or wrong file or directory) : 0, evaluation is over.
- Norm error : evaluation stops.
- As soon as you come accross an exercise that isn't fully fonctional, evaluation stops. The following exercises won't be evaluated.

1) Features testing

Create your own maps or use the map generator given in reference to generate maps. Try them and check for errors.
Keep in mind that some maps have multiple solutions so check by yourself if the offered solution is correct.

2) Bonuses

This part can be filled ONLY for those who've collected all points for features and explanation. Can you work with a bigger grid? Up to which? (5? 9?), give points accordingly, with a 9x9 grid being the highest.

3) Tests Ã©liminatoires


First, run some elementary error handling tests. If you encounter any problem, discuss it with the students you're grading, but don't give them any points.

Carry out the following series of tests :

  - Poorly shaped arguments:
$> ./rush-01 "4 3 2 1 1 2 2 2 4 3 2 1 1 2 2 2 3"
$> ./rush-01 "4 3 2 1 1 2 2 2 4 3 2 1 1 2 2"
$> ./rush-01 "4 3 2 1 1 2 2 2 6 3 2 1 1 2 2 2"
$> ./rush-01 "4321122243211222"
$> ./rush-01 "Bonjours"
Each of these (along with the others you're gonna try) should output an error
  - A wrong grid:
$> ./rush-01 "4 3 2 1 1 2 2 2 4 3 2 1 1 2 2 4"

=> This test is the perfect opportunity to check and discuss the control algorithm.

4) Explanation


Ask the shyest team member to explain how the code works.

If he can't explain it, no matter how other team members reply, leave No in the scale and carry on with the evaluation.

Proceed to asking a series of questions (try grilling the student who seems the most confused) : :

- Ask them about the algorythm they've used, without them being able to look at their code.
- Look for lines with bits transfers (<< and >>) and ask what they are.
- Look for complex lines and ask what it does.
- Ask them to explain recursivity.
- Which data structures ? And why ?
- Ask them what the return value is when the grid has been filled? What happens in the case of an impossible grid?
- Check malloc returns and break their program if possible => if it breaks, select Crash.

- Any other question that comes to mind, be creative ! :)


If a student cannot answer a question at any given time, it's considered cheating, select Cheat.

If explanations are satisfactory, tick Yes.

If even one student cannot answer a question, tick No.
