0) Read

Does the program handle the read syscall when no argument is given?

1) Makefile

The Makefile musn't relink.

If the Makefile recompiles when doing two successive 'make', tick No.
If the Makefile doesn't recompile the second time, tick Yes.

2) Simple preliminaries

- Nothing submitted (or wrong file or directory) : 0, evaluation is over.
- As soon as you come accross an exercise that isn't fully fonctional, evaluation stops. The following exercises won't be evaluated.

3) Correct syntax

Does the program give correct answers with the right syntax (eg. 142 -> one hundred and forty-two)

4) Error handling

This is where you check for potential problems with the program. How does it react when you give an empty string ? Some letters which aren't numbers ? A negative number ?

5) Another langage

Is there a second langage available (through an option for instance) fully working ?

6) Features testing

Play with the program to check for everything.
You should try cases like 0, 000000, 10, 10000, to check if the program works for everything

7) Full test

Try here and determine where did the students stop. Try with very high numbers, thousands, millions, billions... Give points accordingly.
- Correct up until the hundred thousands -> 2 points
- Correct up until the hundred millions -> 1 points
- Correct up until the hundred billions -> 2 points
