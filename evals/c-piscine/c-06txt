0) Simple preliminaries

- Defense can only happen if the student being evaluated is present. This way everybody progresses : by exchanging ideas and sharing knowledge with each other.
- Nothing submitted (or wrong file or directory) : 0, evaluation is over.
- As soon as you come accross an exercise that isn't fully fonctional, evaluation stops. The following exercises won't be evaluated.
- This defense session should last about 10 minutes. You've got other things to do, and 10 minutes should be more than enough to test whether each exercise works as it should.
- In order to grade your peer, you have to clone their git repository on their station.
