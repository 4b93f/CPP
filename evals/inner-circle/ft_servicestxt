0) Simple preliminaries

- Defense can only happen if the student being evaluated is present. This way everybody progresses: by exchanging ideas and sharing knowledge with each other.
- Nothing submitted (or wrong file or directory): 0, the evaluation is over.
- As soon as you come accross an exercise that isn't fully functional, the evaluation stops. The following exercises won't be evaluated.
- In order to grade your peer, you have to clone their git repository on their station.


1) General instructions

- Check if all the necessary configuration files of your application are in the folder srcs.
- Check if the docker-compose and setup.sh files are at the root of the repository.
- Execute "setup.sh"


2) Services environment

- Run the "setup.sh" file and verify if the application is deployed with all containers.
- Check with the "docker ps" command if the evaluated has all the different containers. 
They are nginx, ftps, wordpress, mysql, grafana and influxDB. 
These containers must have the same name. If this is not the case or if a container is missing, the correction stops.


3) Ingress Controller

- Check that redirection to the Nginx server passes by the Ingress Controller. 
To do that use the ip adress to access the server, and read the Ingress configuration files.


4) Nginx

- "Make sure the nginx server redirects on the right sites. Check if the server is open on ports 80 and 443. 
If not, the correction stops here.
To test a few redirections, you can test: ipadress:port. As an example, the ports are 8080, 5050, 3000, etc.
Ask the evaluated to explain his choices and show you his configurations. 
If Nginx does not work as it should, the correction stops here."


5) FTP(s) server

- "Check if the FTPS server is listening on port 21. Make sure it is a FTPS server (s for secure) 
and not a basic FTP server.
If the FTPS server does not work as it should, the correction stops here."


6) Hello Word(press), MySQL and phpmyadmin

- "Check if the WordPress website works on port 5050. Connect to it using the administrator account 
and create a few new users. Make sure the new users are added to the database entries.
For that, you can go to port 5000 to access the phpmyadmin interface and check the database. 
If it doesn't work, the correction stops here. 
The database must persist in case of a crash or if you are stopping the container. 
You can use docker compose to stop the mysql container to test that, and restart it. 
Check if the database persist. You can also delete the container and ask the evaluated 
to show you where the database is saved.
If something does not work as expected, the correction stops here."


7) Grafana and InfluxDB

- "Check if grafana is running on port 3000. Connect to the interface. You have to check if grafana 
is monitoring all containers. To do that search for the dashboard list, click on the dashboards one by one. 
If something does not work as expected, the correction stops here."


8) Hello SSH

- "Check if you have SSH access to the Nginx server. If not, the correction stops here."
